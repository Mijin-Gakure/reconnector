This script monitors Conan Exiles log files to detect when a player has disconnected, and then automatically attempts to reconnect every 6.5 minutes. This feature is beneficial for players who wish to continue collecting points in the game and for admins aiming to maintain server activity above the threshold that attracts new players.

To utilize this script, run it, click 'browse', and locate your ConanSandbox.exe (default location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox.exe). With the game launcher open, click "train" and hover over the "continue" button at the bottom right of the launcher, then press enter on your keyboard. This action records the position of the continue button on your screen. Once the setup is complete, these settings will be saved to the config.json file for future use. To run the bot, simply open it with the game running, click start, and then you can walk away. If you disconnect or the server restarts, the bot will relaunch the game and reconnect you to the server. Click stop and exit when you finish using it.

IMPORTANT: Ensure your mods are configured to match the server you are using this script on. This step is crucial to prevent the bot from restarting every time it attempts to reconnect. For instructions on configuring mods, watch this video: https://youtu.be/20ojprrxrQM?si=90sg93ggEN61HMWh&t=223

This tool was created by me, Mijin, for use on my private Conan Exiles server, Pandemonium PvE-C.
